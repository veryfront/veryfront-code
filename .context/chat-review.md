# Chat components — live review tracker

Single source of truth for the review. ✅ done (type + driver green, last `build-storybook` passed) ·
🔧 pending · ⏳ needs a build/refresh to confirm. I have no headless browser, so visual
confirmation is on you (HMR); I verify types + driver + build.

---

## ✅ Done (verified compiling)

- **Duplicates** — retired v1 stories; one entry per component.
- **ChatInput** — Studio `PromptForm` two-row layout; `+` circular grey bg; submit fixed (ArrowUp/Stop, centered, `icon-primary` size-9); agent-pill slot; top padding trimmed; removed download button, "Model only" story, and the duplicate attachments render (row-gap + missing-×).
- **ChatActions** — `+` trigger has bg + no tooltip.
- **AgentPicker** — dropped invented descriptions + With-Manage/Sections/Manage examples.
- **Reasoning** — chevron direction (collapsed → right, open → down); toggle text visible.
- **Sources + InlineCitation** — hover cards use standard popover surface (no border).
- **Avatar** — initial scales to fit via container-query (fills empty-state avatar).
- **Attachment** — shadcn lifecycle states (selected / uploading+% / processing / uploaded / error+retry) on the component.
- **Alert** — new `Chat/UI/Alert` primitive; 14px text; icons via `AlertIcon`.
- **ToolCall** — error uses `Alert` (error + icon); "Error" title removed; added Running story; removed Badges grab-bag.
- **ModelSelector** — rebuilt on Popover + Command (portals via Floating → no clip; grouped by provider; real models.dev logos; `variant` icon/pill; 16px command items).
- **Dropdown / command items** — reverted to 16px (Alert stays 14px).
- **Alert icons** — added `InfoIcon` + `AlertTriangleIcon` to the barrel; default → info, warning → triangle (were empty circles).
- **Sources snippet** — white bg, tooltip metrics (text-xs, `px-2.5 py-1`, `rounded-md`, no shadow/border).
- **Markdown** — block fences now render through the extracted **CodeBlock** (shiki) instead of `RichCodeBlock`.

## 🔧 Pending — small / medium

- ✅ **Markdown code blocks BROKEN** (1uaxQz) — FIXED. Added recursive `extractText()` (flattens children to text) + dropped `rehypeHighlight` (CodeBlock does its own shiki). Verified in Storybook: fenced `ts` block now highlights correctly (no `[object Object]`).
- ✅ **Markdown prose styling → Studio parity** — DONE. Root cause: the `prose-*` utilities were inert (no `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin in Storybook/consumers). Rebuilt `MARKDOWN_CONTAINER_CLASS` as self-contained arbitrary-variant descendant selectors mirroring Studio's `variantStyles.default` (`[&_h1]:text-lg`, `[&_ul]:list-disc [&_ul]:pl-6`, `[&_li]:my-1.5`, `[&_hr]:border-t`, spacing). Verified in Storybook: h3 heading + bulleted list now render with hierarchy + markers. Dependency-light (no plugin required by consumers).
- ✅ **RichCodeBlock** — DONE. Added `@deprecated` JSDoc pointing to the shared `CodeBlock` primitive; export kept for back-compat.
- ✅ **ChatActions Settings submenu** (uCs0o7) — DONE. Added a close-delay "safe transit" (leaving the row schedules a 160ms close; entering the submenu/row cancels it) + an invisible hover-bridge over the gap, so the submenu is reachable. `onPointerDownCapture` stopPropagation on the submenu keeps the parent menu open when toggling a switch (the submenu is portalled = "outside"). Also fixed a `Floating` `defaultOpen` positioning bug (rAF re-measure) so default-open menus render positioned. Verified via Playwright: submenu opens on hover, survives transit, toggle keeps parent open (screenshots).
- ✅ **CodeBlock** — DONE. Copy button is now an icon-only `IconButton` (`icon-ghost`/`icon-sm`, tooltip "Copy code", no text) matching Studio's ChatCodeBlock; added `CodeBracketsIcon` next to the language label (flat + collapsible headers). Verified in Storybook (screenshot).
- **Buttons everywhere use primitives** — audit the chat components/stories and replace raw `<button>` with the `Button` / `IconButton` primitives (consistent sizing, focus, hover, icon scale). E.g. Reasoning toggle, Sources pills, composer `+`/export, CodeBlock copy, ModelSelector icon trigger, attachment remove.
- ✅ **Tooltip** — DONE. Rewrote `TooltipContent` to portal into `document.body` (escapes iframe/overflow clip) with collision-aware `side` flipping + cross-axis clamp + arrow. Verified via CodeBlock "Copy code" tooltip (screenshot): renders un-clipped, flips to bottom near the top edge.
- ✅ **ChatInput `+` attach menu** — DONE. Replaced the bespoke absolute `div[role=menu]` with the portalled `DropdownMenu` primitive (escapes composer overflow, flips on collision) — items now carry icons (PaperclipIcon → Upload document, FileTextIcon → Select document) at proper size. Single-action case still opens the OS dialog directly. `+` trigger is now the `icon-tertiary` Button primitive. Verified: menu portals to body, no clip (screenshot).
- **Attachment States story** — component supports the states; the "States" story section isn't wired (you were unsure — confirm keep all / some / none).

## 🔧 Pending — bigger per-component rebuilds (Studio parity)

- **AgentCard** — currently a bespoke card (Thinking / Tool Calls / Messages boxes). Rebuild so it's a **`Card`** wrapper with **`Message` components inside**, composing the real parts (use the **primitives** throughout — no raw `<button>`/`<div>` where a primitive exists):
  - **`Card`** container (Card primitive) holding the message anatomy.
  - **Header row**: agent **Avatar** + **name** on the left, **`<Status>`** on the right, e.g. `[avatar]  Whatever Agent            ● Running`.
  - agent **Avatar + name** (copied from Studio).
  - thinking block → **Reasoning** component.
  - tool calls → **ToolCall** card.
  - message text → **Markdown**.
  - Mirror Studio's agent/message anatomy; it should read like a `Message` inside a card.
- **Message** (chat-components-message) — looks unchanged; needs the Studio-parity pass: header (Avatar + name + timestamp), Status top-right, Reasoning toggle, Markdown content, actions (copy / regenerate), token usage. (Was a 🟡 row, out of the original red scope.)
- **ChatSidebar** — "looks totally broken"; make it resemble Studio's chat sidebar (M2PPf6): **slimmer list items**, a per-row **context menu** (rename/delete via DropdownMenu), tighter spacing. Reference Studio `ConversationsPanel`.

## Notes / process
- Rulebook (how we work) is in `chat-components-checklist.md` → "Rulebook — working agreement": visual parity is the gate; read + quote Studio; no invention; renames are moves.
- The recurring root cause of clipping (tooltip, `+` menu, old model dropdown) = bespoke overlays without portal. Fix = use the portalled primitives (Popover/DropdownMenu/Tooltip via Floating).
